### How to use
There are 2 ways to use this tool:
1. Drag one or more `.wad` files onto the executable
2. Start the executable with arguments like
   ```shell
   .\kiwad_unpacker.exe C:\Path\To\File.wad
   ```
   or if you want to select multiple (example for Linux)
   ```sh
   ./kiwad_unpacker ./file.wad ../../wads/files.wad
   ```
Unpacked files will appear in a output/NAME.wad folder located in the executable directory

**‼ IMPORTANT ‼** Windows Defender is overreacting when using this! The CPU usage may rise to 100% because of Windows Defender scanning and analyzing <u>every single</u> file. Please create an exception for your folder in order for the tool to work perfectly.
